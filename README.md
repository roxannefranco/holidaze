## Description

Holidaze is a modern accommodation booking platform thought for all age groups and genders who are looking to quickly and easily book a venue for a nice getaway, vacation, event or business related meet up or simply rent out their own vemues!
There are two aspects to this application: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
A classic minimalist design which is simple, clear and easy to navigate, the user is able to search for venues and view their page before being asked to authenticate by loging in or registering to easily request to book a venue, become a host and create, edit, manage and delete his own venues with a smooth and accessible user experience.

- Every screen size being responsive;
- User testing.
